# zebrafishGC
Python and MATLAB code for Granger causality analysis on empirically observed calcium transients in zebrafish neuronal populations, and on synthetic dynamics generated on toy networks.


The pipeline for analyzing the hindbrain data can be found in gc_pipeline/demo_GC.ipynb

To smooth noisy data using total-variation regularization, please refer to the MATLAB code in tvrg-smooth.

The MATLAB code to generate synthetic data can be find in folders simulate_dynamics, and make_figs. All auxillary functions are included in the folder matlab_tools.
